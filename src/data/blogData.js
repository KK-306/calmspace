Prioritising Mental Health: A Step Towards Healing
Hello and thank you for taking the time to read my first blog. I am Vidhi Maggo, a Counselling Psychologist, and today I want to speak about a topic that is deeply important—mental health.

In today’s fast-paced world, we are constantly managing responsibilities, expectations, and information overload. This often leads us to prioritise everything else while ignoring our own emotional well-being. However, mental health is not just the absence of illness. It is about thriving, maintaining balance, and feeling fulfilled in daily life.

Mental well-being plays a key role in how we think, feel, and function. Seeking support for mental health challenges is not a sign of weakness, but an act of strength and self-awareness.

Simple Ways to Support Mental Well-Being
Practice self-awareness through journaling, mindfulness, or meditation.

Build strong relationships and stay connected with trusted people.

Seek professional help when needed, as therapy provides tools for healthier coping.

Prioritise self-care by taking time to rest, exercise, and engage in activities that recharge you.

Final Thought
Everyone has a unique story, and every emotion matters. Healing is a journey, and taking care of your mental health is an essential part of living a balanced life.

Thank you for reading. I look forward to sharing more blogs in the future. Remember, you are not alone.

Early Warning Signs of Declining Mental Health
Have you ever felt like something was off but couldn’t explain why? In our busy daily lives, we often ignore small changes in mood or behaviour. However, these may be early signs that your mental well-being needs attention. Recognising them early can help you take action and seek support when needed.

1. Persistent Low Mood and Irritability
Occasional sadness is normal, but feeling low for a long time, frequent mood swings, or increased anger without reason may indicate stress, anxiety, or depression.

Helpful steps: journaling, mindfulness, meditation, and professional support if emotions feel overwhelming.

2. Changes in Sleep and Appetite
Insomnia, oversleeping, disturbed sleep, or noticeable changes in appetite and weight can be linked to mental health concerns.

Helpful steps: maintain a routine, reduce screen time before bed, and consult a professional if symptoms persist.

3. Increased Alcohol or Drug Use
Relying on substances to cope with stress may worsen mental health and lead to dependence.

Helpful steps: adopt healthier coping strategies like exercise, support from loved ones, or professional help.

4. Social Withdrawal
Avoiding people or losing interest in social activities can lead to loneliness and may be a sign of depression or anxiety.

Helpful steps: start with small connections and consider therapy if isolation increases.

5. Difficulty with Focus and Memory
Trouble concentrating, procrastination, restlessness, or making frequent mistakes can be early mental health red flags.

Helpful steps: break tasks into smaller goals, practise relaxation techniques, and seek assessment if needed.

Prioritise Your Mental Well-Being
Recognising these warning signs is the first step toward better mental health. Remember, it is okay to seek help. If you notice these red flags in yourself or someone around you, reach out to trained counsellors at CalmSpace for personalised care and support.

Thank you for reading. If you found this blog helpful, please share it with someone who may benefit.

Understanding Suicidal Thoughts and Seeking Help
Suicidal thoughts can feel frightening and overwhelming. While such thoughts may occur during stressful or painful times, it becomes concerning when they are frequent, intense, or hard to manage.

Suicidality exists on a spectrum:

Suicidal ideation: General thoughts or imagining suicide without intent.

Suicidal thoughts: More active, distressing thoughts linked to hopelessness.

Suicide attempts: Acting on or preparing to act on these thoughts, which requires immediate support.

How to Support Yourself or Someone Else
Notice patterns, triggers, and intensity of thoughts.

Remember: thoughts are not facts, and having them does not mean you will act.

Talking openly and listening without judgment can be lifesaving.

Reduce access to harmful means when risk feels high.

Seek professional help as early as possible.

You Are Not Alone
Suicidal thoughts often stem from depression, stress, or emotional pain. Support is available. CalmSpace offers confidential, non-judgmental counselling to help you through difficult times. Visit thecalmspace.in to book a session.

If you or someone you know is in immediate danger, contact emergency services or a crisis helpline right away.

Have you ever found yourself endlessly scrolling, only to realise hours have passed? In today’s screen-driven world, it’s easy to get lost in the digital noise. While technology helps us stay connected, too much screen time can leave us feeling stressed, distracted, and emotionally drained.

A digital detox—taking intentional breaks from screens—can help you reconnect with yourself and improve your mental well-being.

Why Too Much Screen Time Feels Draining
Constant digital exposure can impact mental health in several ways:

Increased stress: Notifications and alerts keep your mind in a constant state of urgency.

Poor sleep: Blue light from screens disrupts melatonin, making it harder to rest.

Reduced focus: Online distractions make concentration and productivity difficult.

Social isolation: Virtual connection can replace meaningful face-to-face interactions.

Taking a break doesn’t mean disconnecting from life—it means creating space for balance.

Simple Tips for a Digital Detox
You don’t need to quit technology completely. Start with small changes:

Set daily screen-time limits or take short scrolling breaks

Create tech-free zones, such as the bedroom or dining table

Turn off unnecessary notifications

Replace screen time with offline activities like reading, walking, or hobbies

Build a relaxing, screen-free bedtime routine

Try doing it with a friend or family member for support

Final Thought
A digital detox can help reduce stress, improve sleep, and restore focus. Even small screen breaks can leave you feeling more refreshed, present, and mentally balanced.

Start small, stay consistent, and notice the difference. A healthier relationship with technology can lead to a healthier you—both online and offline.
